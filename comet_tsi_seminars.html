                    <p><em>Neural networks have been successfully applied to image restoration tasks. 
                        The standard approach directly learns to predict the restored image from the degraded one in a supervised manner. 
                        However, such methods are often unsuitable for satellite image restoration, as they lack interpretability and require retraining for 
                        each specific sensor. Alternative approaches leverage neural networks to learn a prior over target images, which is then integrated 
                        into a classical variational optimization framework for solving inverse problems. This allows for restoring images from different sources 
                        using the same trained network. We focus on a line of work that looks for the solution of the restoration task in the encoded - or latent - 
                        space of a trained generative model. We introduce a variational Bayes framework, VBLE-xz (Variational Bayes Latent Estimation), which enables 
                        approximating the posterior distribution of the inverse problem within variational autoencoders (VAEs). Furthermore, we adopt compressive VAEs, 
                        whose lightweight architecture ensures a scalable restoration process while effectively regularizing the inverse problem through their hyperprior. 
                        Experimental results on satellite images highlight the benefits of VBLE-xz over state-of-the-art deep learning baselines for satellite image 
                        restoration.</em></p>

                    <p><em>Humans perceive the world through multisensory integration, blending the information of different modalities to adapt 
                        their behavior. Contrastive learning offers an appealing solution for multimodal self-supervised learning. 
                        Indeed, by considering each modality as a different view of the same entity, it learns to align features of 
                        different modalities in a shared representation space. However, this approach is intrinsically limited as it 
                        only learns shared or redundant information between modalities, while multimodal interactions can arise in other ways. 
                        In this work, we introduce CoMM, a Contrastive Multimodal learning strategy that enables the communication between modalities 
                        in a single multimodal space. Instead of imposing cross- or intra- modality constraints, we propose to align multimodal 
                        representations by maximizing the mutual information between augmented versions of these multimodal features. 
                        Our theoretical analysis shows that shared, synergistic and unique terms of information naturally emerge from this 
                        ormulation, allowing us to estimate multimodal interactions beyond redundancy. We test CoMM both in a controlled and 
                        in a series of real-world settings: in the former, we demonstrate that CoMM effectively captures redundant, unique and 
                        synergistic information between modalities. In the latter, CoMM learns complex multimodal interactions and achieves 
                        state-of-the-art results on the six multimodal benchmarks.</em></p>

                            Recently, Gaussian splatting has emerged as a strong alternative to NeRF, 
                            demonstrating impressive 3D modeling capabilities while requiring only a fraction of the 
                            training and rendering time. In this paper, we show how the standard Gaussian splatting framework 
                            can be adapted for remote sensing, retaining its high efficiency. This enables us to achieve state-of-the-art 
                            performance in just a few minutes, compared to the day-long optimization required by the best-performing 
                            NeRF-based Earth observation methods. The proposed framework incorporates remote-sensing improvements from EO-NeRF, 
                            such as radiometric correction and shadow modeling, while introducing novel components, including sparsity,

                            Reliably modeling the distribution of species at a large scale is critical for understanding the drivers 
                            of biodiversity loss in our rapidly changing climate. Specifically, the task involves predicting the probability that 
                            a species will occur in a particular location given the prevailing environmental conditions.Traditional approaches from 
                            the field of ecology often tackle the task from a statistical perspective, fitting a per-species density function around 
                            the known occurrences in feature space. These features are hand-crafted from environmental data, and spatial reasoning 
                            is limited to the exact location of a known occurrence. <br>
                            An expanding body of research leverages deep neural networks to learn features in an end-to-end manner 
                            for jointly modeling the distribution of multiple species, capturing potential interactions. These models can derive 
                            rich representations from diverse inputs, including climatic rasters, satellite imagery, and species interaction graphs.
                            In this talk, we will introduce the task of modeling species distributions and give a brief overview of established approaches 
                            in the field, along with their limitations. We will then explore in more detail how the potential of deep learning can help 
                            to overcome these limitations and arrive at a more holistic view of species distribution models.

                            Up-to-date  and precise mapping of the Earth's surface is critical for monitoring  and mitigating the effects 
                            of global warming. For about a decade, Earth  Observation (EO) missions have been providing frequently high-resolution  
                            multispectral imagery of the entire  globe. To exploit the resulting Satellite Image Time Series (SITS),  
                            Deep Neural Networks have become increasingly popular. Nonetheless,  these methods require large amounts of labeled data 
                            for training,  limiting their scalability across diverse geographic regions  and time periods. In response, 
                            there is growing support for  pre-training large deep neural networks, known as foundation models,  
                            using self-supervised learning techniques. These techniques allow models  to learn high-level representations 
                            of input data without  the need for labeled datasets. Once the model is pre-trained, it is  utilized to provide 
                            representations that serve as inputs to shallow models in many downstream tasks. <br> 
                            This  presentation focuses on the development of easy-to-use representations  of SITS for climate experts and 
                            geoscientists. In particular, we propose  a novel DNN architecture (ALISE) capable of generating aligned and 
                            fixed-size representations from inherently  irregular and unaligned SITS input data. In addition, we explore hybrid  
                            self-supervised learning strategies to improve the extraction of high  semantic features in the representations. 
                            For the downstream  applications considered, a single linear layer is trained  on the representations obtained by 
                            the pre-trained and frozen model,  demonstrating the simplicity of exploiting the ALISE representations.

                            Structural pruning of neural networks conventionally relies on identifying and  
                            discarding less important neurons, a practice often resulting in significant accuracy loss that 
                            necessitates subsequent fine-tuning efforts. This paper introduces a novel approach named Intra-Fusion, 
                            challenging this prevailing pruning paradigm. Unlike existing methods that focus on designing meaningful neuron 
                            importance metrics, Intra-Fusion redefines the overlying pruning procedure. Through utilizing the concepts of model 
                            fusion and optimal transport, we leverage an agnostically given importance metric to arrive at a more  effective sparse 
                            model representation. Notably, our approach achieves substantial accuracy recovery without the need for resource-intensive

                            Trained on over 20 years of coupled neXtSIM-NEMO mesoscale simulations (~12 km resolution) 
                            in the region north of Svalbard, the model predicts 12-hour sea-ice evolution. Its inherent stochastic nature enables 
                            robust ensemble forecasting, outperforming all baselines in forecast error while resolving the smoothing

                            in realistic surrogate modelling, it incurs substantial computational costs compared to traditional approaches. 
                            Hence, I will showcase efforts to scale the model to Arctic-wide applications, including leveraging generative diffusion

                            of such techniques is becoming a major concern. In inverse problems in imaging, the focus of this talk, there 
                            is increasing empirical evidence that methods may suffer from hallucinations, i.e., false, but realistic-looking 
                            artifacts; instability, i.e., sensitivity to perturbations in the data; and unpredictable generalization, i.e., 
                            excellent performance on some images, but significant deterioration on others. This talk presents a potential mathematical 
                            framework describing how and when such effects arise in arbitrary reconstruction methods, not just AI-inspired techniques.

                            techniques and the sample quality of diffusion based methods.

                            Representation learning models gained traction as a way to leverage the vast amounts of unlabeled Earth Observation data. 
                            However, due to the multiplicity of remote sensing sources, these models should learn sensor agnostic representations, 
                            that generalize across sensor characteristics with minimal fine-tuning. Sensor agnosticism is strongly related to 
                            multi-modality: more and more models deal with different kinds of data, such as MSI, coordinates, and so on. 
                            These models should also be capable of dealing with images from different locations and different timeframes, 
                            being spatiotemporal invariant. The talk will investigate different approaches to develop these models, such as (continual) 
                            self-supervised learning, spanning different downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and domain adaptation.
